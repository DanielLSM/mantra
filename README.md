# Mantra

The Mantra Library

## AWS Setup

1. Press your name (e.g. "John Smith") in the menubar and click My Security Credentials.

2. Create a new Access Key and make a note of the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

3. From terminal enter the following:

```console
johnsmith@computer:~$ pip install awscli
johnsmith@computer:~$ aws configure
```

Once prompted, enter your AWS details and your default region (e.g. *us-east-1*).

4. Now your credentials will be accessible by the **boto3** AWS SDK library, which will allow **Mantra** to be used to 
provision cloud instances on your request.

5. Once you start an Mantra project (see below) change your projects settings.py file and set the **AWS_KEY_NAME** and **AWS_KEY_PATH** fields - these will determine the credentials of any new instances you create through Mantra.
