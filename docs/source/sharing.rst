Sharing
#######################

You can share your ML objects with your collaborators by simply putting the relevant code online.

üéÅ Downloading ML objects
***************************

You can download an ML object from an URL using :code:`download`:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mantra download https://github.com/user/project/models/mymodel

This will download `mymodel` and add it to the current project. Any mismatch in requirements will be highlighted and if possible automatically fixed.

If the model is trained, it will download the current metadata and saved model and connect the model with the saved history.
