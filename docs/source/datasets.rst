With **Mantra** it's easy to package data for deep learning. In these docs, we are going to see how we make a data package, and how we process it using the powerful :code:`Dataset` class.


üíæ Make a Dataset
**********************

Go to the root of your project. To make a dataset use the :code:`makedata` command. We can make an empty dataset as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mantra makedata first_dataset

Or if we already have a tar.gz file with some data, we can reference it as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mantra makedata first_dataset --tar-path tar_path_here

Our new data folder will be located at **myproject/data/first_dataset**. Inside:

.. code-block:: console

   raw/
   __init__.py
   data.py
   README.md

- :code:`data.py` contains the core :code:`Dataset` class that is used to process your data
- :code:`raw/` contains the tar.gz file with the raw data
- :code:`README.md` is where you can describe the model (useful for sharing the model with others)

If we don't need flat files, but want to import data through an API, we can use the no-tar flag:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mantra makedata first_dataset --no-tar

We now need to extract the input and output vectors X, y that are used to train models ...


‚ú® Magic Data Templates
**************************

Many datasets are standardised, such as a folder of images or a csv file with columns of features and labels. Mantra provides magic templates so you don't have the write the entire class yourself.

üíÅ Images
===============

If we have a tar file that contains a folder of images, we can use the :code:`images` template:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mantra makedata celeba --template 'images' --tar-path celebA.tar.gz --image-dim 128 128

Above we are using the images template. This will create an :code:`ImageDataset` class using the tar file provided. We can also specify additional default options for the template:

  ==================   =================   ===============   ======================================
  Parameter            Type                Example           Description
  ==================   =================   ===============   ======================================
  --image-dim          list                64 64             Desired image dimension (height, output)
  --normalize          bool (flag)         --normalize       Whether to normalize the images for training
  ==================   =================   ===============   ======================================

Once we have executed the command, we can open the :code:`data.py` file:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np

  from mantraml.data import Dataset, cachedata
  from mantraml.data import ImageDataset

  class MyImageDataset(ImageDataset):
      data_name = 'My Image Dataset'
      data_tags = ['example', 'new', 'images']
      files = ['celebA.tar.gz']
      image_dataset = 'celebA.tar.gz' # referring to the file that contains the images

      # additional default data
      has_labels = False
      image_dim = (128, 128)
      normalized = True

      @cachedata
      def y(self):
          # return your labels here as an np.ndarray
          # if no labels, e.g. generative models, then you can remove this method
          return

We can see that we are inheriting from :code:`ImageDataset`. We can also see our input dimensions have entered as a default argument. We can use :code:`sample` to eyeball the data:

.. code-block:: python3

   from data.celeba.data import MyImageDataset

   dataset = MyImageDataset(name='celeba')
   dataset.sample()

.. image:: celebasample.png
   :width: 300px
   :height: 225px

So the advantage of using a template is that we didn't have to write any code. We could, if we wish though, write on top of these templates for some further customisation if we needed it.


üìô Tables
===============

If we have a flat csv file, we can use the :code:`tabular` template to configure it:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mantraml makedata table_data --template 'tabular' --tar-path mydata.tar.gz
   $ --file-name 'my_flat_file.csv' --target 'target_column'
   $ --features 'feature_1' 'feature_2'

This will create an :code:`TabularDataset` class. We can also specify additional options for the template.

  ==================   ===========   ==========================   ======================================
  Parameter            Type           Example                      Description
  ==================   ===========   ==========================   ======================================
  --file-name          str           'my_flat_file.csv'           The name of the flat file inside the tar
  --target             str           'target_column'              The column name to extract as the target
  --features           list          'feature_1' 'feature_2'      The columns to extract as the features
  --target-index       int           0                            The column index of the target
  --features-index     list          1 2                          The column indices to extract as features
  ==================   ===========   ==========================   ======================================

The index options are there if we want to refer to the table by indices rather than column names; if we just want to use column names then we can ignore these options.

Once we have executed the command, we can open the :code:`data.py` file:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np

  from mantraml.data import TabularDataset


  class MyTabularDataset(TabularDataset):

      data_name = 'Example Table Data'
      files = ['mydata.tar.gz']
      data_file = 'my_flat_file.csv'
      data_tags = ['tabular']
      has_labels = True
      target = 'target_column'
      features = ['feature_1', 'feature_2']

We can see that we are inheriting from :code:`TabularDataset`. We can also see our feature and target options are now default argument options. This dataset is now Mantra ready. If we want to alter features from the command line:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mantraml train my_model --dataset table_data --features feature_1 feature_2 feature_3

üìä Custom Data Processing
***************************

If the magic templates aren't useful, you can write your own data processing logic. Open up the :code:`data.py` file:

.. code-block:: python

  import numpy as np

  from mantraml.data import Dataset, cachedata

  class MyImageDataset(Dataset):
      data_name = 'My Image Dataset'
      data_tags = ['example', 'new', 'images']
      files = ['myfiles.tar.gz']
      has_labels = False

      @cachedata
      def X(self):
          # return your features here as an np.ndarray
          return

      @cachedata
      def y(self):
          # return your labels here as an np.ndarray
          return

Simply write your logic for extracting X, y in the above. Your dependency data in :code:`files` will be extracted to a path at :code:`self.self.extracted_data_path`. So if you are extracting data from these files, just open the files from this directory and do what you want with them.

You might be wondering what the :code:`@cachedata` decorator does. It does two things. First it is a property based decorator so you can access the data at :code:`MyImageDataset().X` and :code:`MyImageDataset().y` respectively. Secondly, it caches the data to RAM upon the first call so the processing logic doesn't have to be run twice. If you don't want the caching, then just replace this decorator with :code:`@property`.

üñº Visualizing Your Data Projects
******************************

Load up the UI and click on a model:

.. code-block:: console

   $ mantra ui

.. image:: data_project.png
   :width: 575px
   :align: left

.. raw:: html

 <div style="clear: both;"></div>

In order to customise how the UI looks for your dataset you can add metadata to your dataset classes:

.. code-block:: python

  class PremierLeagueData(MantraModel):
    
      # The Name of the Dataset
      data_name = 'Premier League Data'

      # The Dataset Image
      data_image = "default.jpeg"

      # Link to a Notebook
      data_notebook = 'notebook.ipynb'

      # Tags for the Model
      data_tags = ['football', 'epl']



ü§ñ Accessing Datasets in Models
******************************

When you define a model you pass in a :code:`data` and :code:`task` parameter:


.. code-block:: python

    def __init__(self, data=None, task=None, **kwargs):
        self.data = data
        self.task = task

If you don't have a task, then you have no training/test split, and you can simply access the data at :code:`self.data.X` and :code:`self.data.y`.

If you have a task then you can train your model on the training set explicitly at :code:`self.task.X_train` and :code:`self.task.y_train`.
