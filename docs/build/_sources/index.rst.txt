**Atlas** is an open-source framework for building deep learning software. We turn your deep learning models into portable objects that can be seamlessly trained, evaluated, deployed, and more in a single step. 

With Atlas, you can focus your time on creating models rather than annoying engineering tasks. So ... let's get started!


🌍 Installation
**********************

Atlas is a Python 3 library. You can install via pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install atlasml

👍 Introducing the ML object
*******************************

.. Important::
   ML object is a key concept introduced in Atlas. ML object:

   1. Represents a key ML artifacts, such as a dataset or model
   2. Consists of code, linked data files and metadata
   3. Takes a single step to track, train, evaluate, monitor, package and share

The goal of ML objects is to cover the whole lifecycle of datasets and models. Atlas is currently in alpha so some parts of the lifecycle might be missing, but will be coming soon!

🚀 Quick start with notebooks
*******************************

TODO (what could be a good use case here?)


🚀 Quick start with a Python project
***************************************

Find a directory where you want to create a project and run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ atlas launch my_project_name

This will create a **my_project_name** directory with a folder structure like this:

.. code-block:: console

   data/
   models/
   __init__.py
   atlas.yml
   README.md
   settings.py

- The :code:`data/` folder contains your datasets
- The :code:`models/` folder contains your models
- The :code:`atlas.yml` file contains project metadata
- The :code:`settings.py` file contains project settings

Now we have a project! But what does this mean, I hear you cry? Let's delve in and see what kind of deep learning magic Atlas can do... ✨.
